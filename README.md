as mentioned in the assignment i have made a custom video player with a sidebar playlist.

pause and play button on screen click or by clicking on button and pressing spacebar-key
you can control volume with first slider and control playback speed with second slider min-0.5x and max-2x
skip 10s forward and 10s backward with button click only
adjust video length by simply moving your mouse on video-progress bar
you can convert to full screen mode also.
